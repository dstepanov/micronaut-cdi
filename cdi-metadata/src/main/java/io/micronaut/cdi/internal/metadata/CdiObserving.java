/**
 * Marks a bean that has an observer method, declared or inherited, each of which is annotated {@link CdiObserver}.
 * The container finds the observers of an application by the beans this marks, which the metadata of a bean's
 * reference tells without the bean's definition being loaded, rather than by loading every definition of the
 * application to look at its methods.
